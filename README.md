# BattleShip
This is the group project for the class CIS 121. We are making battleship.
  
By Trevor, Orion, and Shane


RUBRIC:

Loops and selection statements: draw_boards.py, line 184. Used multiple nested loops to grab the right sprite for each line of the grid

I/O file: sprites.py, line 7. Grabs the sprites.json file and later uses it to grab specific ship pieces

Collections: 
1. sprites.py, line 21. List of ship connectors based on their ID. 
2. core_functions.py, line 5. Creates a 2d list. (The entire code is absolutely full of 2d/3d lists as well)
3. Classes.py, line 1. The point class is used repeatedly as well.

Designing with functions: Literally almost any file, we did almost entirely function-based programming outside of the gameloop

Designing with classes: Classes.py, line 1. As stated above, the points class is used frequently
